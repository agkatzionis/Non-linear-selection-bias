# Non-linear-selection-bias

This repository will contain R code to conduct a simulation study to investigate whether selection bias can induce non-linear assoiations in linear models.

This project is an extension of the paper "Relationship between collider bias and interactions on the log-additive scale", which is available [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09622802241306860).

A pre-registration report for our simulation stuy will be made avalable soon.
